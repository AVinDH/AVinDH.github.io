## Tutorial: Curating Oral Histories with Data 

Averaging one to two hours in length, oral history interviews produce
vast amounts of unstructured or semi-structured human language. The
archives that house oral history interviews can be rich sites of
exploration---if visitors can avoid getting overwhelmed.In this
workshop, we will discuss strategies for curating vast amounts of audio for the public using artificial intelligence and statistical methods.

Using our Obama Presidency Oral History and the Elders Project digital
archives as case studies, together we will work through key processes
and decision points, as well as their implications.Workshop participants
will develop a sense of what tools are available when using data to
curate, strategies for working with large audio archives, and ways of
thinking about how to make these tools work toward a project's design
goals.No prior experience in oral history or programming necessary.

**Chris Pandza** is a designer and oral historian at Columbia University whose practice focuses on making oral history archives more interesting, accessible, and equitable. Pandza has led public-facing design for the Obama Presidency Oral History and Elders Project.
