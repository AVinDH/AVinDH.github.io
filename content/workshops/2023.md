DH2023's theme "Collaboration as Opportunity" focuses on
transdisciplinary and transnational collaboration, asking to explore how
mutual empowerment and collaboration can transform regional hubs of
expertise to international networks of excellent research, to the
benefit of the global DH community. This workshop will take place on
Tuesday, July 11th, 2023.

The AVinDH SIG Workshop will bring together DH scholars interested in
analyzing AV materials. All DH2023 attendees are welcome to join. One
does not have to be a member of the AVinDH SIG, although we would be
delighted to have you join our mailing list here!

The day-long workshop will include:

-   Interactive Tutorial that share approaches and methods for
    computational image and audio analysis.
-   Lightning Shorts where participants can briefly share projects, with
    a focus on works in progress
-   An "Unconference" to share mutually-engaging topics and
    collaboratively develop conversations.

The Lightning Shorts session will focus on current research in AV DH. 
Each participant will have five-minutes to introduce their work.
Participants in the lightning shorts must also sign-up for the day-long
AVinDH workshop.

        -   As note-taking is the natural support of any research
            activity (whether or not it is based on video), it is
            essential for the researcher to have, the possibility of
            associating her/his analyses or comments to the materials
            that constitute her/his corpus and to be able to share them
            easily with a peers community. This workshop will allow
            participants to discover several apps dedicated to video
            annotation and to test one of them: Celluloid
