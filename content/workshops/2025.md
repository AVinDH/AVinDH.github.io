The theme of the DH2025 emphasizes openness and accessibility of
scholarly knowledge. Following this idea, the AVinDH SIG invites all the
interested parties -- from complete novices to hard core wizards -- to
join our workshop to discuss the present status and future avenues of
research on AV materials within the DH.

All DH2025 attendees are welcome to join. One does not have to be a
member of the AVinDH SIG, although we would be delighted to have you
join our mailing list
