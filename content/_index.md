Welcome at the website of the ADHO Special Interest Group **AudioVisual Material in Digital Humanities (AVinDH)**. Our SIG AVinDH is meant to be a venue for exchanging knowledge, expertise, methods and tools by scholars who make use of audiovisual data types that can convey a certain level of narrativity: spoken audio, video and/or (moving) images.

The group facilitates communication and interaction between researchers from various disciplines including domains such as media studies, history, oral history studies, visual culture studies, social signal processing, archeology, anthropology, linguistics.

AVinDH is sponsored by the [Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO)](https://adho.org). To get involved, join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/avindh) and attend our annual workshop at the next ADHO DH conference in Lisbon, Portugal.
